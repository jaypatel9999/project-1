    </h1>
    <p>
        I am pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology from Silver Oak University, with a CGPA of 8.65.

        I am highly passionate about frontend development, and I have hands-on skills in React JS, along with HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript.

        During my academic journey, I also worked on a project using Machine Learning and Python, which helped me
        strengthen my technical knowledge and problem-solving skills.

        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am interested in coding challenges, puzzle solving, and listening to music, which keep me motivated.

        My strengths are that I am a quick learner, have strong work ethics, and I am highly dedicated to my work.

        Regarding my weakness, time management is something I am improving by planning my tasks better and following a
        proper schedule.
