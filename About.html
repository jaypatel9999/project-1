            About Me
        </h2>
         <p>
            I am a motivated and dedicated IT student who loves learning new technologies. I enjoy working on real-world projects
            and improving my development skills daily.
            <br><br>
            I like solving coding challenges, exploring frontend UI designs, and learning modern JavaScript frameworks.
            <br><br>
            My strengths are that I am a quick learner, consistent, hardworking, and good at teamwork.
            <br><br>
            One weakness I am improving is time management, and I am working on it by planning tasks and following a schedule.
